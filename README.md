* Blocklists

My favorite combination of blocklists for uBO and YogaDNS.

If necessary, I recommend only to use highly false-positive blocklists and URL shorteners with uBO, because it let us cancel every false positive block.

* RethinkDNS: https://1-7c7tqbaeabtqhsijamiseaim4cbaavbqucjeb2qaba.max.rethinkdns.com

These blocklists include aggressive security blocklists, moderate ads, and telemetry blocklists.

* Param-Blocklist

Integrates lists from [1](https://github.com/kong0107/search-params-remover) and [2](https://github.com/mpchadwick/tracking-query-params-registry).

Web extensions to bleach URL params: [3](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/clearurls/lckanjgmijmafbedllaakclkaicjfmnk) and [4](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/search-params-remover/gfmcbkcihnobpalkdakmmecajahgnnol).
## My DIY lists.
* Winshield-Aesterisk
* Winshield

They must block most of Windows native trackers. They must break Microsoft services and Windows updates, but are worthy for those who value privacy more.

For more Windows telemetry blocklists, check out those in RethinkDNS and [Hagezi's](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/main/domains/native.winoffice.txt) blocklist.
