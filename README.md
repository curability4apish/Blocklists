* Blocklists

My favorite combination of blocklists for uBO and YogaDNS.

* RethinkDNS: https://1-7c7tqbaeabtqhsijamiseaim4cbaavbqucjeb2qaba.max.rethinkdns.com

These blocklists include aggressive security blocklists, moderate ads, and telemetry blocklists.

* Param-Blocklist

Integrates lists from [1](https://github.com/kong0107/search-params-remover) and [2](https://github.com/mpchadwick/tracking-query-params-registry).

## My DIY lists.
* Winshield-Aesterisk
* Winshield

They must block most of Windows native trackers. They must break Microsoft services and Windows updates, but are worthy for those who value privacy more.

## My Suggestions on Privacy Protection
1. Web extensions to bleach URL params: [3](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/clearurls/lckanjgmijmafbedllaakclkaicjfmnk) and [4](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/search-params-remover/gfmcbkcihnobpalkdakmmecajahgnnol).
2. For more Windows telemetry blocklists, check out those in RethinkDNS and [Hagezi's](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/main/domains/native.winoffice.txt) blocklist.
3. Block connections of native apps with RethinkDNS app to prevent native tracking.
4. For those who value privacy more, I recommend using slightly agressive blocklists and URL shorteners with uBO, because it let us cancel every false positive block.
